Diabetes Patient Guide

Introduction

Diabetes is a chronic health condition that impacts how your body processes food into energy. The body typically breaks down carbohydrates into glucose (sugar), which then enters the bloodstream. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose enter cells to be used as energy. In diabetes, this process is disrupted due to either insufficient insulin production or the body's inability to effectively use insulin. This leads to elevated blood sugar levels, which over time can cause serious health issues.

There are three primary types of diabetes:

Type 1 Diabetes: An autoimmune condition where the immune system attacks and destroys insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. It usually develops in childhood or adolescence and requires lifelong insulin therapy.
Type 2 Diabetes: The most common form. Here, the body becomes resistant to insulin or the pancreas doesn’t produce enough. It often occurs in adults but is increasingly seen in younger individuals due to lifestyle factors.
Gestational Diabetes: Occurs during pregnancy when the body cannot produce enough insulin. Although it often resolves after childbirth, it increases the risk of developing type 2 diabetes later in life.
Symptoms of Diabetes

Common warning signs include:

Excessive thirst and frequent urination
Unexplained weight loss
Fatigue and irritability
Blurred vision
Slow-healing sores or frequent infections
Tingling or numbness in hands or feet (especially in Type 2)
Diagnosis

Several tests are used to diagnose diabetes:

Fasting Blood Sugar Test (FBS): Measures blood sugar after an overnight fast. A level ≥ 126 mg/dL indicates diabetes.
HbA1c Test: Shows average blood sugar over the past 2-3 months. A level ≥ 6.5% indicates diabetes.
Oral Glucose Tolerance Test (OGTT): Measures blood sugar before and after drinking a sugary drink. A 2-hour level ≥ 200 mg/dL confirms diabetes.
Random Blood Sugar Test: A level ≥ 200 mg/dL with symptoms confirms diabetes.
Treatment Options

Type 1 Diabetes

Requires daily insulin injections or use of an insulin pump.
Blood glucose monitoring using glucometers or CGMs.
Dietary planning to count carbohydrates.
Type 2 Diabetes

Starts with lifestyle changes (diet, exercise, weight loss).
Oral medications like Metformin are common.
Insulin therapy may be needed if blood sugar remains uncontrolled.
Gestational Diabetes

Managed with a healthy eating plan and regular physical activity.
Blood sugar monitoring is essential.
Some cases require insulin therapy during pregnancy.
Medications


Type	Common Medications	Purpose
Oral Drugs	Metformin, Sulfonylureas, DPP-4 Inhibitors, SGLT2 Inhibitors	Improve insulin sensitivity and secretion
Insulin	Humalog, Lantus, Levemir, Novolog	Replace or supplement insulin
Non-Insulin	GLP-1 Receptor Agonists (e.g., Ozempic, Trulicity)	Lower blood sugar and support weight loss
Always consult your healthcare provider before starting or changing medication.

Diet & Nutrition

Proper nutrition is essential in managing diabetes:

Focus on whole grains, lean proteins, vegetables, and fruits.
Avoid sugary drinks, sweets, and refined carbs.
Monitor carbohydrate intake carefully.
Stay hydrated.
Diabetic Plate Method

Fill half your plate with non-starchy vegetables.
One-quarter with lean protein.
One-quarter with whole grains or complex carbs.
Exercise Guidelines

Physical activity helps control blood sugar and maintain a healthy weight:

Aim for at least 150 minutes of moderate aerobic activity weekly (e.g., walking, cycling).
Include resistance training 2-3 times per week.
Always carry a source of fast-acting sugar during workouts in case of hypoglycemia.
Monitoring Blood Sugar

Regular blood sugar checks help prevent complications:

Use a glucometer or continuous glucose monitor.
Track fasting, post-meal, and bedtime glucose levels.
Target Ranges

Fasting: 80–130 mg/dL
Post-meal (2 hours): Less than 180 mg/dL
Complications (If Unmanaged)

Long-term high blood sugar can lead to:

Heart disease and stroke
Kidney damage (nephropathy)
Eye damage (retinopathy)
Nerve damage (neuropathy)
Poor wound healing and possible amputations
Precautions & Daily Tips

Take medications as prescribed.
Maintain consistent meal and medication timing.
Inspect your feet daily for cuts or infections.
Attend regular doctor visits and lab tests.
Manage stress through relaxation techniques.
Avoid smoking and limit alcohol intake.
Emergency Situations

Hypoglycemia (Low Blood Sugar)

Symptoms: Shakiness, sweating, confusion, dizziness
Immediate action: Consume 15g of sugar (e.g., glucose tablets, fruit juice), recheck in 15 minutes.
Hyperglycemia (High Blood Sugar)

Symptoms: Excessive thirst, frequent urination, fatigue, nausea
Action: Take prescribed medication, hydrate, monitor sugar, and seek medical help if levels stay high.
Conclusion

While diabetes is a lifelong condition, it can be effectively managed through informed lifestyle choices, regular monitoring, and proper medical care. Education and consistency are key to living a healthy, active life with diabetes.
